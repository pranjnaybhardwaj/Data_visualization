# Data Visualization for Air Quality Analysis

This document presents the findings of my master's project for the Data Management & Visualization module. The project utilizes air quality data, specifically focusing on PM (particulate matter) particles, collected from DPD vans by the Insight SFI Centre. 

To effectively convey the data, I employed two primary visualization techniques:

1. Heatmaps: These were used to illustrate areas with high pollution densities, providing a clear and intuitive representation of spatial pollution distribution.
2. Bar Charts: These visualizations facilitated the comparison of air quality across different EU nations, highlighting variations and trends in particulate matter concentrations.

By leveraging these visualization methods, the project aims to offer a comprehensive and professional analysis of air quality patterns and disparities within the European Union.
